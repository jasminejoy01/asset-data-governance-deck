# Asset Data Governance & Quality Strategy

This presentation was created for a data specialist application. It demonstrates my approach to:

- Structuring asset hierarchies and metadata for scalable use
- Designing dimensional data models (STAR schema)
- Building interactive data dictionaries using Excel + Power BI
- Implementing governance and QA frameworks using SQL, Python, and Git

It also outlines real-world data migration challenges and my solutions using bounding box checks, referential tests, and hash comparisons.
